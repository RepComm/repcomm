I'm Jon Crowder, currently working as tech support / system admin.
I write software in my free time, and also to make my job easier.

My aim is to tackle global challenges with creative problem-solving, while fostering happiness and understanding. I'm on a path to gain IT certifications like CompTIA to enhance my skills.

I believe conflict can be outsmarted, and I strive for a world where diversity thrives in peace and prosperity. Informed consent and self-governance are key.

Mistakes are part of progress. In my experience, it's not about getting everything right, but about learning what not to do. This allows room for experimentation and growth without causing irreparable harm.

Ultimately, I want to extend my influence beyond the limits of my mortal body, pursuing a future where harmony and coexistence flourish.

- I want hunter-gatherer and food-microwaves to be engaged and happily married.
- I want to reduce the necessity for food market trips by learning to grow food.
- I want to see other life forms granted the liberties I hope for myself.
- I don't want to end other creatures one chance to live so that I may eat if I can find another way.
