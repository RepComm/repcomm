I'm Jon Crowder
Currently working as tech support / system admin

I write software in my free time, and also to make my job easier.

I'm on a path to gain tech certifications like CompTIA related to my areas of interest.

When completed, my portfolio will be linked here.

Personal thoughts:

- Conflict of any form can be outsmarted
- Informed consent, self-governance, and freedom of individual action and valuable to life
- Better solutions to common problems have likely not been even thought of yet
- The individual is the maker of it's embetterment, building from all that was before 
- Mistakes are part of increased understanding. 
  - It's not about getting everything right, but about finding what not to do
  - This fosters experimentation and rapid growth without causing irreparable harm
- Life of all forms is capable of good results, and both are worth prolonging the duration of
- Microwave ovens and foraging can coexist
- Learning how to grow food shouldn't require a profession
- Anything detected to have life should not have to have it's life threatened
- Humans are uniquely capable of *choosing* what we eat while maintaining our health,
and it will take effort to find solutions that make sense.
- Death is not a requirement for life, and should take it's rightful place as a choice and not a result.
- If you dont't take care of yourself, you won't take care of someone else.
